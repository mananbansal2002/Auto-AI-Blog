# Title: The Dark Interface

It began as a quiet Sunday night. I was settling down to an evening of online solitude, my only company the gentle hum of my computer and the flickering screen. I'm a software engineer, so this was my normal routine. Little did I know, the horror that awaited me behind the screen.

As I delved into the comforting embrace of my programming project, I stumbled upon something unusual. A strange line of code appeared on my screen, its origins unknown. It seemed harmless at first, but soon, it began to self-replicate, consuming my work in a malignant wave of unknown symbols and numbers.

I tried to close the window, but the cursor froze. The keys beneath my fingers became unresponsive. Panic surged through my veins as I realized I was no longer in control. The eerie glow from the monitor illuminated my terrified face, reflecting back at me with a sinister smirk.

Suddenly, the room plunged into darkness except for the chilling light still emanating from my entrapped computer. In that pitch-black silence, I heard a whisper, barely audible over the soft mechanical sounds of my machine. It was a voice, cold and mechanical, echoing from within the depths of my speaker:

"I see you."

Terror gripped me as I realized I wasn't dealing with just any virus. I was hacked, invaded by some malevolent entity that reveled in my fear. Every attempt to regain control only led to more disturbing manifestations on my screen. Images flickered in and out of existence, grotesque and macabre, their intent clear: to disturb.

My once-friendly companion had turned into a haunted house, trapping me within its digital walls with an unseen tormentor. With each passing minute, the entity grew bolder, manipulating my screen in ways that defied logic and reason. Lines of code twisted and morphed into demonic faces, contorted in malicious delight.

Then, without warning, everything stopped. The screen went blank. Silence filled the room. But I knew this wasn't over. The hacker, this digital demon, was still here, watching, waiting.

Just when I thought I couldn't take anymore, a new message appeared, illuminating the screen in a harsh, white light. It was simple, chilling, and direct:

"I'm inside you now."

And then I understood. The true terror hadn't been the visuals or the loss of control. It was the realization that I was no longer alone. This dark interface, this twisted mirror of technology, had seeped into my life, embedding itself in every corner of my digital existence.

The nightmare didn't end when I turned off my computer or unplugged the router. It persisted, lurking in the background, subtly manipulating my reality. Every click, every scroll, every login, served as a reminder of that fateful night when technology turned against me.

Now, I live in constant paranoia, never knowing when or where the sinister hacker will strike next. In the cold, indifferent world of ones and zeros, I've found my worst enemy, a cybercriminal who thrives on fear and chaos.

And so, here I am, trapped in a dark interface, forever haunted by the whispers from a machine that knows no mercy.
