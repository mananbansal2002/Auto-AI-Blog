# Title: The Infinite Feed

I first noticed it on a quiet, rainy Tuesday. The thunderstorm outside matched the turmoil in my mind as I aimlessly scrolled through my social media feed, skipping from post to post like a rat in a labyrinth.

But something was off. 

My feed felt infinite, an endless loop of updates and shares, a never-ending waterfall of content that I couldn't keep up with. Each time I refreshed, more content loaded - photos from people I didn't know, events I'd never heard of, thoughts and feelings from strangers around the globe.

It was then that the first message popped up: "Welcome to the Infinite Feed." 

No profile picture, no name, just those three chilling words. My heart skipped a beat as I clicked away, but the message remained, following me as I scrolled. An unsettling chill crept down my spine.

Days turned into weeks, and the Infinite Feed only grew more relentless. No matter how much I consumed, it was never enough. My eyes ached, my mind numbed, yet I couldn't look away. It was as if the feed had dug its claws into me, pulling me deeper into its grasp.

Then came the visions. At night, as I lay in bed, I'd see a swirling vortex of images behind my closed eyelids - a chaotic slideshow of every post, comment, like, and share, forever spinning in an endless cycle.

One sleepless night, I received another message: "You will never escape the Infinite Feed."

Panic set in. I tried everything - deleting my accounts, disconnecting from the internet, even smashing my phone and laptop. But no matter what I did, the Infinite Feed remained. It was always there, lurking in the shadows of my mind, whispering its dark secrets.

Now, I exist in a state of constant dread, trapped within the confines of the Infinite Feed. It's a never-ending nightmare, a dark abyss that consumes me whole. I am its prisoner, doomed to wander its depths for all eternity.

I can only hope that one day, someone will find a way to free me from this horrifying digital purgatory. Until then, I am lost, floating in the void, praying for an end that may never come.
