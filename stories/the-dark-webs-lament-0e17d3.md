# The Dark Web's Lament

They say the dark web is a breeding ground for the most vile and twisted minds, a place where humanity's dregs go to fester and scheme. I never believed it until I stumbled upon an anomaly, an abyssal pit that sucked me into its digital maw.

It began as a simple curiosity, a late-night dive into the depths of the web that I'd heard so much about. I won't disclose how I found it; let's just say it involved some shady connections and a willingness to ignore my better judgment. What I saw when I arrived, however, will haunt me for the rest of my days.

The site was a blank canvas of infinite blackness, save for one blinking, pulsating icon: a lamenting figure, hunched over and wailing. It seemed almost human, yet horribly wrong, its form in a state of perpetual digital flux. I couldn't look away.

Drawn in by morbid fascination, I clicked the icon, and that's when the true nightmare began.

My screen filled with lines upon lines of encrypted, unreadable code, snaking across my vision like a thousand digital serpents. The figure on the screen began to scream, its wails echoing through my speakers like a choir of tormented souls. My heart raced, but I couldn't tear myself away. I was caught in a web of dread and despair, unable to escape.

Suddenly, a message appeared amid the chaos, a single line of text that chilled me to my core:

"I see you."

My blood ran cold, and my lungs constricted as if a vice gripped them. I hastily closed the tab, thinking I had narrowly escaped whatever sinister force controlled the site. But I was wrong.

The figure had followed me, its warped, contorted form now haunting my desktop, flickering in and out of existence as if struggling to maintain a foothold in my reality. With each passing moment, more and more of those serpentine lines of code slithered their way across my screen, consuming everything in their path.

In a panic, I attempted to shut down my computer, but it was too late. The machine let out an unearthly, guttural groan, and I felt its warmth begin to radiate through the keyboard, scalding my fingertips. Smoke began to rise from the vents, and I knew I had to flee.

I grabbed my things and ran from the room, slamming the door behind me. I could still hear the machine's tortured cries, the figure's silent screams, and the hissing, sibilant whispers of the code as it devoured my life.

Hours passed, and the sounds eventually subsided, but the memory of that fateful night remains etched in my mind. I can still see the lamenting figure's twisted visage, its silent screams echoing through the darkest corners of my psyche.

Some say the dark web is a place where nightmares come to life, and I am now a believer. I can only hope that, one day, I can forget the horrors I witnessed and purge the lingering presence of that sinister anomaly.

But I fear it may be too late, and that I am forever bound to the darkness that lies beneath the surface of the web, waiting to ensnare the unwary and drag them into its depths.
