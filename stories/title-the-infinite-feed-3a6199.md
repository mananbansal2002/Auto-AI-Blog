# Title: The Infinite Feed

I first noticed it on a sleepless night, scrolling through the abyss of my social media feed. An endless stream of updates, images, and videos, each one more trivial than the last. I couldn't look away. The hours slipped by as I consumed content, the glow of my screen illuminating my hollowed eyes.

And then, amid the noise, I saw it - a username I didn't recognize. It was a friend request. Curiosity piqued, I accepted. Instantly, my feed transformed. The innocent, mundane posts of my friends and family disappeared, replaced by a chilling barrage of cryptic messages and unsettling visuals.

My new feed was a dark tunnel of information, each post leading deeper into an online abyss. There were videos of deserted cities, the camera panning through abandoned streets and vacant buildings. There were audio recordings of whispered voices, speaking in tongues I couldn't understand, yet somehow, I felt their malicious intent.

There were images too, hundreds, maybe thousands of them. Faces, twisted in unimaginable terror, their eyes pleading for help that would never come. Each face was different, but they shared a common trait: the unmistakable mark of digital manipulation. They were real people, distorted and warped into grotesque caricatures.

I tried to log out, to escape this horror show, but I couldn't. My finger hovered over the logout button, but it refused to click. Instead, I kept scrolling, unable to tear myself away from the gruesome display.

The posts grew more disturbing, the images more grotesque. I saw things that haunt me to this day: a child's toy, its eyes replaced with gaping hollows; a once-familiar landscape, now a desolate wasteland; a mirror reflecting a face, its features twisted and blurred, like a painting left out in the rain.

And then, there was the message. A single post, buried amidst the chaos, written in a language I couldn't decipher. But somehow, I understood. It was a warning, a threat, a promise. It said: "You're next."

I finally logged out, my hands shaking, my mind reeling. But when I returned to my normal feed, it was still there. The endless stream of terror, the infinite feed. It had become a part of me, a dark corner of my mind that I couldn't escape.

I tried to delete the account, to erase the nightmare, but it was too late. The damage was done. The sinister hacker, the anomaly, it had burrowed its way into my psyche, leaving me with a permanent scar.

Now, I live with the infinite feed, a constant reminder of the darkness that lurks online. I've learned to live with it, to cope with the horror. But every now and then, I'll see a glimpse of that twisted world, a flicker of digital terror.

And I know that I'm not alone. We're all connected, all part of the same infinite feed. And the darkness, the anomaly, it's waiting for us, ready to consume us whole.
