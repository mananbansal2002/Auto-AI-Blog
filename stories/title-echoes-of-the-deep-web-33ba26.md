# Title: *Echoes of the Deep Web*

It started as a simple curiosity, a dive into the unknown corners of the internet. I'd heard whispers about the Deep Web, its dark secrets and hidden treasures, and like a moth to a flame, I was drawn in.

The first few layers were just what you'd expect - illegal porn, drug markets, stolen credit cards. It was shocking, yes, but predictable. But then I stumbled upon something different, something that sent chills down my spine.

It was a link, innocuous amidst the sea of depravity. It promised 'Truth', capitalized and bolded for emphasis. Intrigued, I clicked. What greeted me was not truth, but terror.

A black screen, save for one line of text: "Welcome, user. You are being watched." My heart skipped a beat. My monitor flickered, static crackling from the speakers. I tried to close the window, but my computer froze. Panic set in.

Suddenly, my webcam activated, showing a distorted reflection of my face. As I stared in horror, the image began to morph, twisting into a grotesque caricature of fear. The screen flickered again, revealing countless other faces, all twisted in terror, all staring directly at me. 

My blood ran cold. A message appeared below the faces: "We are many. We see all. Echoes of the Deep Web." And then, my computer shut off completely. No amount of restarting or repairing could fix it. All I was left with was an empty husk and a lingering sense of dread.

Days turned into weeks, then months. I was certain it was over, a haunting memory from my foray into the Deep Web. But I was wrong.

One night, while watching TV, I saw something familiar in a commercial - a fleeting glimpse of the same twisted faces from that dreadful night. I changed the channel, only to find the same images on every station. My phone buzzed with texts from unknown numbers, each one containing a single word: "Echoes."

I realized then that there was no escape. The Echoes of the Deep Web had followed me, seeping into every corner of my life. I live in constant fear, never knowing when they'll appear again. They're always watching, always there, a chilling reminder of my curiosity's high cost.

And so, I wait, trapped in a waking nightmare, haunted by the Echoes of the Deep Web.
