# The Unseen Violence of Cyberspace

It was past midnight when I received the first message. A simple, innocuous email from an unknown sender. The subject line read, " ever seen your darkest fears?" I hesitated, then clicked it open. Attached was a grainy video file. I downloaded it, my curiosity piqued. 

As the video played, my heart sank. It was a recording of my screen as I worked earlier that day. But there were differences, subtle yet chilling. My documents had been tampered with, words twisted into sinister messages. My browser history now included searches I knew I hadn't made - violent, disturbing queries that made my stomach churn. 

Paranoia crept in. I checked every corner of my house, half-expecting to find an intruder. But I was alone. This wasn't physical; it was virtual, a ghost in the machine. 

Days turned into weeks. Every move I made online was mirrored back to me, altered and malicious. Photos were doctored, conversations distorted. I became a prisoner in my own digital life, constantly watched, manipulated, and threatened. 

One night, I woke up to my computer screen glowing ominously in the dark. A new message was displayed: "I know what you're dreaming." Attached was a series of images - screenshots from my webcam, capturing me in my most vulnerable moments. Sleeping, crying, screaming. 

I unplugged everything, threw away my router, switched to a dumb phone. But it didn't matter. Wherever I went, whatever I did, the terror followed. The unseen violence of cyberspace had ensnared me, and there was no escape.

Now, I sit here, writing this confession. The cursor blinks rhythmically, like a heartbeat. Or perhaps it's the pulse of the sinister entity that haunts me. I don't know how or why this is happening. All I know is that I am not alone. In the vast expanse of the internet, someone is watching. Always.
