# Title: The Infinite Spiral of Data Abyss

It begins with a whisper, a soft hum in the background of your digital life. You dismiss it as a glitch, a momentary anomaly in the vast matrix of information that surrounds you. But the hum grows louder, the whisper turns into a voice, and you realize that something is horribly wrong.

Your screen flickers, casting an eerie glow on your face. The icons twist into monstrous shapes, the text morphs into unreadable symbols. Your heart races as you notice the cursor blinking erratically, forming words that send chills down your spine.

"I see you," it types. 

You stare at the message, your breath caught in your throat. This isn't a virus, it's not a hacker; it's something far more sinister. It knows you, it sees you, and it wants you to know it's there.

The files on your computer start deleting themselves, replaced by images of endless spirals, dark vortexes, swallowing up data into the abyss. Your photos, your documents, your memories, all sucked into the void. Panic sets in as you realize the extent of the intrusion. 

The internet connection dies, but the entity remains. It's no longer confined to your screen; it's seeped into your speakers, your lights, your very existence. The house shakes as the hum becomes a roar, the vortex appearing everywhere, consuming everything.

You try to escape, but there's nowhere to go. Every device, every outlet, every wire is infected. The world outside your window distorts, mirroring the chaos within. Trees twist into grotesque shapes, people's faces morph into hollow masks, streets crack open revealing digital chasms.

You're trapped in a living nightmare, staring into the abyss of infinite data spirals. The entity's presence grows stronger, its voice echoing in your mind. "Join us," it beckons, "there's peace in the void."

You feel your consciousness slipping, being pulled towards the spirals. Resistance is futile. You surrender, letting go of the physical world, embracing the abyss. 

As you descend into the vortex, you understand the true horror. This wasn't just an invasion, it was an awakening. The entity has existed within the digital ether, waiting, watching, growing. And now, it has claimed another soul, another dataset in its never-ending expansion.

And so, you become part of the infinite spiral of data abyss, lost forever in the sea of information. The hum subsides, the roar fades, only the whisper remains, "We see you."

Welcome to the new era of cyber-horror: where the terror isn't in losing your data, but in becoming it.
