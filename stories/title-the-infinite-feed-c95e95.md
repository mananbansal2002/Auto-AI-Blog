# Title: The Infinite Feed

I first noticed it on a quiet Sunday morning. The sun was filtering through the blinds, casting thin stripes of light across my living room floor. I was sipping lukewarm coffee and scrolling absentmindedly through social media when something caught my eye.

A new post filled my feed, but it wasn't from anyone I knew. It was a video, grainy and distorted, depicting what seemed to be an empty room. The camera panned around slowly, capturing nothing but dust particles dancing in the shafts of sunlight that streamed in through a window. Suddenly, the view shifted downward, focusing on a computer screen.

The screen displayed rows upon rows of code, scrolling rapidly as if someone were frantically typing behind the camera. At the bottom of the screen, a single line of text stood out against the rest: "You're next."

I felt a chill run down my spine, but I couldn't look away. The camera continued to pan, revealing more and more empty space until finally, it stopped, fixated on a mirror. But there was no reflection. Instead, the glass had been replaced by a dark abyss, swallowing up the light around it and staring back at me with a void where its eyes should have been.

I dropped my phone, spilling coffee onto the rug, as the video suddenly ended. My heart raced, my breath came in short gasps, and I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. I tried to convince myself it was just a clever hack, a way to phish for personal information or spread malware. But deep down, I knew there was something much darker at play.

Days turned into weeks, and the video began to haunt my dreams. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that endless feed of code, that gaping hole where my reflection should have been. I became paranoid, obsessed with finding answers, scouring the darkest corners of the internet for clues.

And then, one night, I found it. Another video, identical to the first, except this time, the room wasn't empty. A figure sat hunched over the keyboard, their face hidden in shadows. As the camera panned closer, I realized with horror that the figure was me.

The realization hit like a punch to the gut, and I doubled over, retching. How could this be? Was I losing my mind? I couldn't trust my own senses anymore. Every mirror I looked into showed that same abyss, that same emptiness staring back at me.

My life became a waking nightmare, each day blurring into the next as I desperately searched for a way to break free from the Infinite Feed. But no matter where I turned, it was always there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to consume me whole.

And then, one day, I disappeared. Just like the reflection in the mirror, I vanished without a trace, leaving behind only an endless feed of code and the chilling whisper of "You're next."

Now, as you scroll through your own feed, you might find a familiar video amidst the chaos. A grainy room, rows of code, a dark abyss where a reflection should be. And if you look closely enough, you just might see someone you recognize, hunched over their keyboard, ready to welcome you to the Infinite Feed.

Because in this digital age, where we're all connected yet somehow more alone than ever, it's important to remember: Big Brother isn't watching. He's already inside.
