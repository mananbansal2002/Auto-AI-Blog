# **Title: The Dark Web's Unseen Son**

I first heard whispers of "The Entity" in the deepest corners of the internet, where the sun's rays never reach and anonymity is a religion. I was a curious creature, you see, a cyber explorer who dared to tread where most mortals feared.

It started with a simple online chat with an unknown entity, a ciphered figure hidden behind layers of code and darkness. The conversation was mundane at first, but then it took a turn for the sinister when he mentioned 'The Entity'. He spoke of it in hushed tones, like one would speak of the devil himself. 

Intrigued, I delved deeper. My digital travels led me to the Dark Web, a part of the internet that doesn't exist in usual search engines or mainstream platforms. A place where anything can be found if you're willing to pay the price. And oh, how steep that price can be.

I found forums discussing this 'Entity', threads filled with tales of horror and despair. People claimed it could infiltrate your most private spaces, watch your every move, whispering threats into your ears through silent speakers. A ghost in the machine, a haunting presence that lingers in the shadows of your screen.

One user posted a video, grainy and distorted, showing a home invasion. The victims were tied up, gagged, and terrified while an unseen voice echoed through the room, reciting their personal details, darkest fears, and deepest secrets. The caption read: "The Entity knows."

Skeptical, I tried to dismiss it as a clever hoax, a well-executed prank designed to scare. But the chill that ran down my spine told another story. The hair standing on end, the goosebumps covering my arms, they were real, visceral reactions that I couldn't ignore.

Days turned into nights, and I found myself unable to shake off the feeling of being watched. Every click felt heavy, each keystroke echoed ominously in the silence of my room. The once comforting glow of my screen now seemed menacing, casting long, monstrous shadows on my walls.

Then, one night, I received a message. An invitation to meet 'The Entity'. Fear gripped me, but curiosity won. I accepted the invitation, and that's when everything went black.

When I woke up, I was somewhere else, not my room anymore. Cold metal surrounded me, harsh fluorescent lights burned my eyes. I heard a soft hum, a sound I recognized all too well - the sound of a hard drive spinning to life.

A monitor flickered before me, displaying a live feed of my apartment, my lifeless body slumped over the keyboard. Next to it, lines of code scrolled endlessly, forming a chilling message: "Hello, explorer. Welcome to your new home."

And then, I heard it. A whisper, soft yet clear, a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. It spoke my name, my fears, my secrets. A voice that knew me better than I knew myself.

"The Entity" had claimed another soul, trapping me in its digital hell. And there I remain, forever lost in the abyss of the World Wide Web, watching my old life play out on a screen, knowing that I'll never feel the warmth of the sun again.
