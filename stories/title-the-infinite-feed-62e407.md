# Title: The Infinite Feed

I first noticed it on a quiet, rainy Tuesday. The thunderstorm outside matched the turmoil in my mind as I aimlessly scrolled through my social media feed, the incessant pinging of notifications lulling me into a trance-like state.

My finger froze mid-scroll when I saw it - a post from someone I'd never met before. It was a simple text image: "I see you." Chills ran down my spine despite the muggy air in my room. I dismissed it as a prank, some kid trying to scare people for kicks. 

But then, more posts started appearing. From different accounts, all saying the same thing: "I see you." Each one sent another shiver down my spine, but I couldn't tear myself away. It was like watching a horror movie; I knew I should look away, but the morbid curiosity held me captive.

Suddenly, my screen flickered and went black. A moment later, text appeared in stark white letters against the dark screen: "I see you, even when you think I don't." A chill ran through me, followed by a creeping sense of dread. This wasn't just some prank anymore. 

The messages kept coming, flooding my notifications. They invaded every platform, every device. No matter where I hid, they found me. And then they took it further. Photos started appearing - images of me in my own home, taken without my knowledge or consent. 

My heart raced as I yanked the cords out of my computer, plunging my room into darkness. But the messages continued, now spoken aloud through my speakers in cold, emotionless tones. 

There was no escape. Whoever was doing this knew me better than I knew myself. They knew my fears, my secrets, my vulnerabilities. And they used it against me, turning my own life into a living nightmare.

Then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped. The messages ceased, the photos disappeared, and silence fell. I waited, expecting the terror to resume at any moment. But nothing happened. Had they tired of their game? Or were they simply biding their time, waiting for the perfect moment to strike again?

I don't know how long I sat there, trembling in the darkness. All I knew was that I couldn't escape that eerie phrase echoing in my mind: "I see you." It had become more than just a threat. It was a promise, a sinister reminder that I was never alone, never safe.

The internet is a vast, infinite feed, filled with endless streams of content, connections, and possibilities. But beneath its surface lies a dark undercurrent, where anonymity breeds monsters. And sometimes, those monsters see you.
