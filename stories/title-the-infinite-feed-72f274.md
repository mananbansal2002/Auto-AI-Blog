# Title: The Infinite Feed

I first encountered the anomaly late one restless night, my insomnia driving me to the dark corners of the internet. I should have been asleep, but instead I found myself scrolling through an endless sea of morbid images and disturbing text posts on a forum I had never seen before.

The page was an obsidian void, save for the stark white text that seemed to drill into my skull. The posts were unnerving, describing vivid nightmares and eerie experiences that left me questioning my own sanity. Yet, I couldn't look away.

As I scrolled deeper, the posts became darker, more personal. They started addressing me directly, telling me things they couldn't possibly know. My name, my fears, my secrets - all laid bare by this twisted digital confessional.

Suddenly, the screen flickered and changed. Gone were the text posts; replaced by a live feed of my own home. I watched in horror as my every move was broadcast in real-time, the voyeuristic invasion sending chills down my spine.

But then, something even more terrifying happened. The feed began to glitch, distorting my surroundings into a grotesque funhouse mirror reflection. My furniture morphed into gnarled, twisted versions of themselves, while shadows danced menacingly in the corners of each room.

The anomaly had not only invaded my privacy but also twisted my reality. The line between digital and physical grew blurrier with each passing second, trapping me in a nightmare from which I could not escape.

And so, I sit here now, trapped in this infinite feed, my life displayed for the world to see and mock. Every minute brings new horrors, new invasions of privacy, new distortions of reality. I can only hope that someone out there will find a way to stop this madness before it consumes me entirely.

Until then, I scroll. I watch. I wait. And I pray that one day, I'll wake up from this living nightmare. But until then, the feed never stops. It just keeps going, an endless, terrifying loop of my own personal hell.
