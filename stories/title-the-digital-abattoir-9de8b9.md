# Title: The Digital Abattoir

It was a ordinary day, or so it seemed. I still recall that chill, the kind that seeps into your bones and clings like a specter. The clouds hung low and heavy with rain, the air pregnant with an unspoken dread. My fingers danced across the keyboard, each keystroke echoing in the silent room. The soft glow of the screen illuminated my face, casting long shadows that danced on the walls.

Suddenly, my computer chimed, a notification from an unknown sender. A harmless .jpg file, innocuous enough. I clicked, and the world shifted. The screen flickered, then filled with a scene that turned my blood to ice. A room, bare and sterile, save for a single chair in its center. And on that chair, a man, bound and gagged, eyes wide with terror.

I watched, horrified, as a figure emerged from the shadows. A hacker, clad in black, face hidden behind a mask. They moved with a predator's grace, every motion precise and calculated. A knife glinted in their hand, and I screamed, but no sound left my throat.

The hacker approached the man, and I could only watch in helpless horror as they raised the knife. The man struggled, but it was futile. With a swift, brutal motion, the hacker slit his throat. Blood gushed, a crimson flood that pooled around the chair. The man's eyes lost their light, and he slumped, dead.

The screen went black, then returned to normal. I sat, shaking, the image of the murder seared into my mind. I knew then, with chilling certainty, that I had witnessed a digital abattoir, a place where lives were extinguished for the twisted pleasure of a sick, hidden monster.

I reported the incident, but the authorities could find no trace of the crime. The hacker had covered their tracks, leaving no trace of their heinous act. I was left alone, haunted by what I had seen, a silent witness to a murder that never was.

Days turned into weeks, and I was plagued by nightmares, the scene of the murder playing on an endless loop in my mind. I could not escape the terror, the guilt, the unshakable feeling that I was next.

And then, one day, another notification. I hesitated, then clicked, steeling myself for the worst. The screen filled with a single sentence, written in blood red text.

"I see you."

I closed the laptop, heart pounding, cold sweat beading on my forehead. I knew then, with a certainty that chilled me to the core, that I was not alone. The hacker was out there, watching, waiting. And I was their next target.

The digital abattoir is real, and it's open for business. The question is, will you be the next to enter?
